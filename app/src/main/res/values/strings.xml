    <string name="what">    \"Two Winks\" is a simple reminder app for the ones who usually spend hours playing gadgets, or the ones who want to keep their body fine while playing gadgets. This app contains the reminder of the \"Rule of 20\" and the reminder to do the two important but rarely done things while playing gadgets, that is to drink and to stretch.</string>
    <string name="why">        We have to do those things because sometimes, when we are already busy with our gadgets doing business, we\'ll forget about our eyes\'s and bodies\'s healthiness that will make us feel regret later. </string>
    <string name="how">        The Rule of 20 (20–20–20 rule), popularized by Dr. Jeffrey R. Anshel from California, a specialist in vision ergonomics, states that to relieve eye strain one should close their eyes or gaze at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds after every 20 minutes of screen time. In that context, Two Winks will send a notification to the user as a reminder of the Rule of 20. As for the other reminder, the app will send the notification every 2 hours to drink and every 4 hours to stretch. Users just have to click the notification that will lead them to the \’Fun Facts!\’ menu (from the main menu), containing videos of what do they have to do. </string>

    <string name="bout_us"> \”Two Winks\” is our final project of our study program in our Boarding School, Fahim Quran Plus. Rule of 20 is our main idea, but our headmaster, Ust. Purwanto Abdul Ghaffar, is also one the reasons why we build this application. He has once done the coding for 3 days straight and ended up getting a serious muscles condition. That incident moves us to also put the other features in this application. Here to contact us:
