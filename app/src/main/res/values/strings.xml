        <item>10 Simple and Relaxing Exercises for Your Eyes and Give You Great Eyesight
	            \n \n
            \n \n
Endless hours sat in front of a computer or a TV can be really bad for your eyes. Dryness, itchiness, headaches. Unfortunately, not all of us can afford to regularly go offline for a much needed break. And deliberately exercising your eyes can help immeasurably to maintain great vision. Here are ten such exercises which will take you no more than ten minutes to do.
            \n \n
            \n \n
1. Blink for 2 minutes.
	            \n \n
This exercise helps to regulate blood circulation inside your eyes.
            \n \n
            \n \n
2. Rotate your head in a circular motion while staring ahead.
	            \n \n
First right to left, then up to down. This increase the blood circulation in your eyes.
            \n \n
            \n \n
3. Look to your right then slowly move your gaze left.
	            \n \n
Then do the same thing with the opposite direction.
            \n \n
            \n \n
4. Close your eyes and relax.
	            \n \n
Darkness is believed to help strengthen the photoreceptor cells in your eyes, which in turn can help maintain clear vision.
            \n \n
            \n \n
5. Move your gaze in various different directions.
	            \n \n
Side to side, up and down, moving it diagonally, rolling it in a circle, and draw an eight figure.
            \n \n
            \n \n
6. Close your eyes tight for 3 - 5 seconds, then open them.
	            \n \n
Repeat it 7 times. This helps to relax your eye muscles and increases blood circulation to your eyes.
            \n \n
            \n \n
7. Lightly push against your temples with your fingers.
	            \n \n
Maintain this pressure for around 2 seconds. Repeat 4 - 5 times. This improves the flow of interocular fluid.
            \n \n
            \n \n
8. Keeping your eyes open, and draw simple geometric figures with your gaze.
	            \n \n
Then move on to more complicated shapes.
            \n \n
            \n \n
9.Close your eyes and slowly move your eyeballs up and down.
	            \n \n
Repeat for 5 - 10 times.
            \n \n
            \n \n
10.Strengthen your eyes\' near and far focusing.
            \n \n
-	Place your thumbs about 10 inches in front of your face and focus on it, also on an object that is 5 to 10 feet away for 10 - 15 seconds.
                        \n \n
-	Then, focus on an object that is 10 - 20 feet in front of you without moving your head. Focus on it for 10 - 15 seconds.
                        \n \n
-	After 10 - 15 seconds, refocus on your thumb.
                        \n \n
